## NUTRIFEST
This is a web application that provides audio educational content on how to resolve malnutrition and hunger to ensure good health adoption in marginalized communities.

It is an OpenSource project that provides educational information on practical ways to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) two - To end
hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition. Read more about SDG goals [here](https://sdgs.un.org/).

In a bid to ensure the agenda of  this application is met, it provides content in both English Language and Yoruba Language which are the most common modes of communication in these communities.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
This project was created from the [WOM.fm](https://wom.fm) template. Alongside the template, technologies used include html, css and vanilla javascript.

## COLLABORATION
This Project was achieved in collaboration with a Non Governmental Organization, the first FoodBank in Nigeria,   [Lagos Food Bank](https://lagosfoodbank.org/), whose objectives are a perfect fit for this project.

## The TEAM
This project was worked on by Team Extraordinaire for the She Code Africa Hackfest 2022.
